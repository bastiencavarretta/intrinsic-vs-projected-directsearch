# intrinsic-vs-projected-directsearch
This repository contains the code for the paper "Complexity guarantees and polling strategies for Riemannian direct-search methods"

# Use
1. Set up the python environnement (we used a python 3.13.5 virtual environnement) by running 

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Run cell by cell the `directsearch_experiments.ipynb` file to obtain the data profiles and performance tables from section 6. The cell performing the direct-search ran for three hours in our case.

3. Run cell by cell the `cosine_measure.ipynb` file to obtain the plots from section 5.
